#         `shared`   uses the shared GSA stored in vault for authenticating CircleCI jobs
#         `uuid`     uses the CircleCI project UUID in a path to `secrets/circleci/<uuid>/gsa to fetch the GSA
#         `reponame` uses the reponame in a path to `secrets/circleci/<reponame>/gsa to fetch the GSA
#
# optional:
#   VAULT_INSTANCE       using specific vault instance.  'produciton' by default
#
# setup vault for useage with circle OIDC /  jwt identity
# the CIRCLE_OIDC_TOKEN _must_ be present for this to operate.
# We use this token to auth with vault and set the VAULT_TOKEN for jobs
# for more info on how this works see https://github.com/pantheon-systems/vault-kube/blob/master/docs/circleci.md
